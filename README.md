# Pixelfed Starter Kit Specification

The Pixelfed Starter Kit provides a way for new accounts to automatically apply a curated set of actions and settings to enhance their initial experience. These starter kits use the ActivityPub protocol with custom extensions to automate actions such as following accounts, blocking unwanted content, and setting default configurations. This README explains each component of the Starter Kit JSON object.
